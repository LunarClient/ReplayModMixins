# ReplayMod Mixins

This project contains Mixins into ReplayMod we use for cosmetic & compatibility changes.
ReplayMod is licensed under the GPL, and jgui is licensed under the MIT license.

These Java classes are not required to be open source by the GPL, but we make these files public
so others can understand and copy our changes to ReplayMod. They are not buildable as-is because
they use internal Lunar Client APIs. This project is licensed under the MIT license.

If you have found a bug in ReplayMod that only occurs when using Lunar Client, please report it
using this project's issue tracker.
